TrackFlow Privacy Policy

Last Updated: January 14, 2026

TrackFlow ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our Chrome Extension handles your data.

1. Data Collection and Usage TrackFlow does not collect, store, transfer, or transmit any personal or sensitive user data to external servers.

Local Storage: All job listings, application statuses, and notes you save are stored locally on your device using the Chrome storage.local API. This data never leaves your browser.

External Sites: We do not track your browsing history. The extension only interacts with the specific job board page you are currently viewing when you explicitly click the "Add Job" button.

2. Third-Party Sharing We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your information to outside parties. Since all data is stored locally on your device, we have no access to it.

3. Contact Us If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at: rezwan99@gmail.com
